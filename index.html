            <p>When you truly care for someone, their mistakes never change your feelings..... because it's the mind that gets angry but the heart still chares. In the shadow of your warm love, I feel so safe and secure, And your soft, caring hands, Urge me on to bravely endure. Your smiles soothe and ease the pain Of another dark and lonely day; The rainbow appears amid the rain, My sorrow as quickly melts away. A reassuring glow within your eyes Tells me that you uderstand The complicated ways of my sighs Born of thoughts truly grand. I continue to look upon your face And gain a calm heart, my sweet solace.</p>

            <p>pehali najar mein dil de diya hai, tumako mohabbat mein o jaaneja, seene se lag ke tum jo kaho toh, has kar de du yeh apani jaan, pehali najar mein dil de diya hai, tumako mohabbat mein o jaaneja
            baahon mein aakar tum jo kaho toh, has kar de du yeh apani jaan, pehali najar mein dil de diya hai, tumako mohabbat mein o jaaneja, Mere sanam kahin tu aisi jagah chal, jahaan na aaj ho na ho koyi kal
            uss jagah pyaar hi pyaar ho, bich koyi na deewaar ho, siwa pyaar ke koyi cheej bhi aaye na dono ke darmiyaan… </p>

            <H3>JOURNEY OF TWO LOVE BIRDS</H3>
            <P>I dream of a woman clothed in white. She wears wings that shine with golden light. Her hair is fine like that of an olden wife. Her eyes hold a vision of the road of life. She whispers love through the winds. Then rivers of love flow to my heart and my spirit ascends. I grow embraced by heavenly heights. Then glow rays of warmth and light. I wait only for her touch of the purest. I fall to her holding of love, of spirit! We become one in loving presence together. In love, we come to heaven forever. Like two doves we sing and dance. Love of a queen and king. Love will forever last.</P>

            <H3>ON THIS 2 YEARS ANNIVERSARY</H3>
            <p>A smile is such a lovely thing especially upon your face; hiding all the sorrows or simply taking their place. A kindly spoken word means so much when from you, it comforts my weary heart or when I’m feeling blue. A song can make our hearts dance in pretty fast-paced clips when we hear the melody of our love’s unconquerable grips. Words could lift my spirits and sweet compassion find; put your hand in mine alone and peace will fill my mind. A Smile, a word, a song, a look – seem small little things but when love sparks an action, what blessings they bring. [Queen of my Heart]</p>
